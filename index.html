                        My name is Zachary Goldston. I am a Computer Science Student at the University of
                        Michigan from Aurora, Ohio. I grew up being on FLL and FTC teams as the lead
                        programmer, and found that I have an extreme interest in developing softare
                        and learning about how to improve upon existing algorithms for computational systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of classes, I am the Subteam lead of the Autonomous Navigation System in Michigan Mars Rover,
                        the incoming Secretary of Tau Beta Pi, a grader for Math classes at Michigan, and an active member
                        of Math Club and Michigan Hackers. I also occasionally volunteer for Quiz Bowl. You can also find me
                        playing the cello, golfing, skiing, or ranting about the stock market in my free time.

                    <p>
                        I am passionate about Machine Learning applications in finance and robotics. I am a quick learner who
                        is always willing to learn from mistakes, and I want to make sure even in my failures, I can achieve
                        future success.

                        My main activity is being the Autonomous Navigation subteam leader for Michigan
                        Mars Rover. For our Navigation challenge at the University Rover Challenge, our rover must be able to navigate through a set of posts with AR tags on them,
                        with the width of them decreasing by a meter as the competition progresses. My projects this past year were to develop an improved gate traversal algorithm that would produce more consistent results, by relying on the position of both posts rather than just one. Additionally, I rewrote our obstacle detection program to use the "least resistance" turn when trying to find the optimal angle to turn to when navigating an obstacle. These are just a couple of projects I have done for the Auton
                        team. I additionally help with finances on the business team, and helped rewrite
                        some of the team's website <a href="https://mrover.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. Being on Rover is instrumental
                        in continuing to develop my interpersonal skills and teamwork with other disciplines in the engineering community. I am also able to
                        demonstrate leadership and deal with risk management when exploring new methods and capabilities of our rover. Some of these methods are creative, out of
                        the box ones only a group of people would be able to develop.

                    <p>
                        For the past two summers, and during the Fall 2020 semester, I got the chance to
                        work for Rockwell Automation right out of high school. The first two summers I worked in
                        the Rockwell Engineering Pathways Program in the Embedded Software department. My main projects
                        were to work on internal systems for device comformance testing, creating developer tools to
                        speed up information parsing, and later, working on a custom error reporting tool. During the 
                        Fall semester, I was able to continue working for them as an Embedded Software Intern, and
                        experience day-to-day operations and meetings. The core tenants of this experience was teamwork, 
                        systems thinking, lifelong learning, and cultural awareness through seminars on race and bias
                        hosted by the company.

                        This semester, I became an electee, and later the incoming Secretary, of Tau Beta Pi.
                        I was able to meet other academically successful and forwarding thinking engineers 
                        looking to give back to the community while networking with top companies and organizations.
                        I volunteered at several events, from tutoring sessions to K-12 learning symposiums.
                        Through TBP, I am taught less about the technical side of things and instead focus 
                        on topics like ethics, communication, empathy, and cultural awareness.
