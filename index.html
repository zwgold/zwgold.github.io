                        My name is Zachary Goldston. I am a Computer Science Student at the University of
                        Michigan from Aurora, Ohio. I grew up being on FLL and FTC teams as the lead
                        programmer, and found that I have an extreme interest in developing softare
                        and learning about how to improve upon existing algorithms for computational systems.

                        of Math Club and Michigan Hackers. I also occasionally volunteer for Quiz Bowl. You can also find me
                        playing the cello, golfing, skiing, or ranting about the stock market in my free time.

                    <p>
                        Since August 2021, I have been an Instructional Aide (IA) for a couple of Computer Science courses at the University of Michigan.
                        I have taught EECS 445 (Machine Learning) in Fall 2021, and EECS 280 (Introductory Programming and Data Structures) in Winter 2022,
                        Spring 2022, and Fall 2022. In this role, I am responsible for hosting my own lab/discussion to review course content, having office hours
                        to assist with course assignments, responding to admin emails, developing new course material (primarily labs and discussion notes), and
                        writing/grading exams. I have been able to improve my communicaton skills, teamwork, and mentorship through this role.

                    <p>
                        In Fall 2022, I am the President of the Michigan Gamma Chapter of TBP. 
                        In my role as President, I oversee the vision of the chapter, and lead both the Officer Corp and Advisory Board in making decisions to
                        impact chapter functions. Additionally, I am responsible for running mailout, which is stuffing all the letters we send to eligible candidates.
                        During my tenure, I oversee nearly 50 new members electing to our chapter, have attended our national convention, (earning a couple of awards)
                        updated our bylaws and constitution to allow new graduate programs to be eligible, as well as modified financial policies to allow for better
                        overseeing on our balance with the Association. (nationals) I have also managed to move money into our endowment fund, to ensure future cash
                        solvency. Leadership, reconciliation, organization, and management are the most important skills I have developed in this role.

                        Previously, I was the Secretary during the 2021-2022 school year. As Secretary I represented our TBP Chapter
                        at the national level and inform them about our election records, spending, and what events
                        we host. I informed decisions about events and spending our local organization does. During my tenure, I completed reports
                        within record time, sometimes even a month before the deadline. Through TBP, I am taught less about the technical side of things and instead focus 
                        on topics like ethics, communication, empathy, and cultural awareness.

                        autonomus mission portion of the competition. I assist the leads and members on the subteam with designs, code reviews, and management.

                        our team placed first overall for the competition, and had either the best or second best autonomous mission score. Some of the skills I have
                        learned in these roles includes C/C++ Development, Python Development, Agile Workflow, team management, and multidisciplinary design.

                        Since August 2021, I have hosted sessions to help students through EECS 280. These sessions are meant as additional help
                        outside of the assistance the course provides. There are two near-weekly sessions that occur back to back: One for course
                        content/review, and another for project overview, where we provide tips and insight into implementation. We also get to provide
                        additional 1 on 1 help at the end to reinforce concepts, and provide advisory tips for future courses.

                        During the summer of 2022, I worked with Capital One in their Chicago, Illinois office under their Card Tech division. I worked
                        with 3 other interns to improve an internal API/Dataset system that reports on transactions in a given timeframe, as well as reporting
                        them at both a client and endpoint level. I additionally attending corporate sessions on benefits of working at Capital One, different lines of 
                        business I could work in, DEI, and technical sessions on cybersecurity and AWS. At the end of the summer, we presented our project to appropriate
                        clients and managers, and after that, visited the company headquarters in Mclean, Virginia. In this role, I developed and improved my 
                        full stack skills, and learned new technologies like Java Spring, NgRx, and Angular.

                <p>
                    My life purpose is to use my computer expertise and drive to build systems in financial markets to improve accessibility to all individuals and improve market data canonicalization / reporting for company-wide benefit. After the recent session, and on reflection, I find myself wanting to work within this scope based on my own past experiences, upbringing, and current interests and hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I find my perfect world to be one where I can pursue my deepest fulltime interests, where others are not hampered by limitations to access opportunities and resources within communities, such that it is replaced by equitable options for everyone. Anyone would be able to make the most of their lives and explore any path, and my effort to do so would be from a financial accessibility standpoint. In the past few years, especially since I started studying at the University of Michigan, I’ve seen a clear divide for those who can use financial resources and technologies to their advantages versus those who are either unable to, are unaware, or feel stereotyped. Being from a more well brought-up background, I want to change this for not just my peers, but for everyone in the same situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When pursuing this idea, I do have a few goals to attain. At the very least, I will need to have a commanding understanding of the infrastructure and design skills necessary to explore this field of software engineering. On the less technical side, other goals include identifying companies whose goal is to clear these barriers and gain insight into their current efforts and technologies to do so. Looking back 10 years from now, I hope that my efforts and focus to pursue these initiatives will pay off, whether I begin my own company or work at a pre-existing one to change it for the better.
